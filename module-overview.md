You've been working as a **freelance web developer**, but now you're aiming to secure a developer position at a promising new startup in Hungary: **Sudsy**. You have already **successfully completed** the first round of the hiring process, and you have been selected from over 100 candidates for the second round, where only the **top six** candidates remain.

In this round, you have **three different tasks**. First, you will need to create a backend with multiple **REST API** endpoints to serve Sudsy's **front-end** applications. Then you will develop an admin application that will be used by the employees. Finally, you will develop a new version of the showcase website.

Descriptions of the three tasks:

- [Module A - Backend](module-a.md)
- [Module B - Admin](module-b.md)
- [Module C - Design and frontend](module-c.md)

## Technical Environment

You can solve the tasks by developing them on your own machine.
